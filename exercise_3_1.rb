# [1] Define a Document class that has 3 attributes (author, title, content)
      #add getter and setter methods (hint  - attr_accessor)
      # Initializer function should be like this: initialize(attributes={})

# [2] Add an addition function that returns a new document with the concatenation
# of the caller and passed document content. (title and author should be the caller's)

# hint: 1+3 is actually: 1.+(3)  where + is the function name
# hence if we have Document a and Document b
# calling a + b should return a document (c) with the new content

# [3] modify the function so that we could also do this: a + "abc", which also
# returns a document with the concatenation of of the content of a and "abc"
